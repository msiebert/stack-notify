stack-notify
============

Stack Notify is a service that hopes to make Stack Overflow reputation gathering easier! The main source of reputation points is answering questions, but it can often be hard to find questions you can answer. Stack Notify solves this problem by providing notifications when a new question is asked in an area you know about. Just tell the system what tags you want to follow, and Stack Notify will inform you when new questions are asked. Through the simple UI, you can quickly determine whether you might know how to answer the question, or whether you should just ignore it.

Stack Notify will first be implemented as a Chrome Extension. It is a final project for BYU's CS 462.
